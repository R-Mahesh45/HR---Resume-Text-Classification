# 📄 **Resume Classification Application**  

### 🛠️ Developed By: **Mahesh Rathod**  
Welcome to the **Resume Classification Application**, an intelligent tool for analyzing resumes and predicting job profiles with skill extraction! 🚀  

---

## 🎯 **Features**
- 📂 **Upload resumes**: Accepts multiple file types (`.pdf` and `.docx`).
- 🧠 **Skill Extraction**: Automatically extracts relevant skills from resumes.
- 🔍 **Job Profile Prediction**: Uses machine learning models to classify resumes into job profiles.  
- 📊 **Interactive Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for easy interaction.

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**
1. **Upload**: Drag and drop your resume(s) in `.pdf` or `.docx` format.
2. **Processing**: 
   - The application preprocesses the resume text.
   - Skills are extracted, and the text is classified using a trained ML model.
3. **Output**: 
   - Displays uploaded file details.
   - Shows extracted skills and the predicted job profile in a clean table format.
